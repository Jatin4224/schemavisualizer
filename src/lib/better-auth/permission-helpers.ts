/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: PermissionGroup, getPermissionGroups,
 *   permissionsToStatement, statementToPermissions, PermissionStatement
 *
 * WHAT:  Registry-derived helpers for the role builder — groups every
 *        permissioned resource into a UI-friendly list, and converts between a
 *        flat `Permission[]` and the `{ resource: [actions] }` statement map
 *        stored on OrganizationRole.permission.
 * WHY:   The permission toggles and the stored role shape both derive from the
 *        SAME RESOURCES registry, so adding a verb to a resource adds a toggle
 *        and a storable permission with no extra wiring. The statement map is
 *        exactly what src/trpc/init.ts parses back into permission strings.
 * WHERE: getPermissionGroups → permission-switches UI; permissionsToStatement
 *        → organizationRoles.create/update handlers; statementToPermissions →
 *        reading an existing role's permissions for editing.
