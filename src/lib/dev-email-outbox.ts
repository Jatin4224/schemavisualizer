/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: recordDevEmail, takePendingDevEmail, DevEmailEntry
 *
 * WHAT:  A tiny in-memory outbox of "emails" that COULD NOT be sent because
 *        RESEND_API_KEY isn't configured. Stores the action link (verification /
 *        reset / invitation) so the dev UI can surface it in a toast instead of
 *        the link being lost.
 * WHY:   In local dev without an email provider, verification/reset links would
 *        otherwise only hit the server console. Recording them here lets a
 *        dev-only tRPC query hand the link back to the client. In-memory + best
 *        effort by design — this is a local-dev convenience, never a delivery
 *        mechanism (the endpoint that reads it is gated to development).
 * WHERE: Written by src/services/email.service.ts when a send is skipped; read
 *        (and cleared) by src/trpc/routers/dev.ts (getPendingEmail).
