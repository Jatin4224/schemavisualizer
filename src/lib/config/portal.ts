/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: portalConfig, isPortalEnabled, isPortalOwnerEmail,
 *   PORTAL_PATH
 *
 * WHAT:  Env-driven config for the platform-admin portal — whether it's on, the
 *        designated owner email that bootstraps the first admin, and the route
 *        prefix.
 * WHY:   One place resolves the portal env so the rest of the app reads
 *        constants. `isPortalOwnerEmail` is the single source of truth for "is
 *        this the operator": an exact, case-insensitive, trimmed match — no
 *        wildcards or partial matching (a security boundary). The owner email
 *        is server-only (NOT NEXT_PUBLIC), so client callers always see it as
 *        empty and the real gate runs server-side.
 * WHERE: Read by src/services/portal.service.ts (admin resolution + auto-
 *        provision), the /portal layout, and the dashboard/onboarding portal
 *        redirects.
