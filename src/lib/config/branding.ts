/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: APP_NAME, APP_DESCRIPTION, APP_URL,
 *   APP_METADATA_BASE, APP_DOMAIN, BRANDING
 *
 * WHAT:  Public app identity strings + URL primitives plus the consolidated
 *        BRANDING object (upgrade-modal copy, metadata base).
 * WHY:   One file resolves env-driven branding so the rest of the app reads
 *        constants, not `process.env`, keeping client/server output stable.
 *        BRANDING holds visual / textual identity ONLY — no routes or
 *        redirect targets. Sign-in route lives in AUTH_ROUTES
 *        (src/lib/config/auth-routes.ts); product nav routes live on the
 *        corresponding RESOURCES entry's `nav.href`.
 * WHERE: Re-exported from src/lib/config/index.ts; consumed by metadata,
 *        layouts, auth.ts, and the upgrade-modal UI.

 * WHY:   One frozen record so UI surfaces never reach into env or duplicate
 *        copy strings; {resourceName} placeholder is interpolated from
 *        RESOURCES[x].name at render time. Intentionally has NO `routes`
 *        field — routes are not branding (see file header).
 * WHERE: Consumed by upgrade modal copy and layout metadata.
