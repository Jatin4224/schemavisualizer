/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: RootPage
 *
 * WHAT:  Root index — fires a single auth-required tRPC query, then sends the
 *        authenticated user on to the dashboard. Renders nothing meanwhile.
 * WHY:   The query is the auth probe: anonymous → server throws UNAUTHORIZED →
 *        the AuthRedirectObserver bounces to sign-in (auth-flow stays
 *        centralized, never a per-page `redirect`). On success the user is
 *        authenticated, so we push to ROUTES.dashboard — the dashboard layout
 *        then owns the no-org → onboarding redirect. This page never decides
 *        the auth target itself; it only forwards the happy path.
 * WHERE: Auth enforcement: authProcedure (src/trpc/procedures/protected.ts);
 *        redirect handler: AuthRedirectObserver (src/trpc/react-provider.tsx);
 *        landing route: ROUTES (src/lib/config/routes.ts).
