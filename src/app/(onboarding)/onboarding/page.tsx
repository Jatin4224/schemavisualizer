/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: OnboardingPage
 *
 * WHAT:  /onboarding route — server-guarded entry to the org-creation wizard.
 *        Sends anonymous users to sign-in and portal owners to /portal;
 *        otherwise renders the client OnboardingFlow. Reachable both as the
 *        forced destination for a user with no org AND intentionally via the
 *        org switcher's "Create organization" (an existing user creating an
 *        additional org) — so it does NOT redirect users who already have an
 *        org away, which would make that action flash back to the dashboard.
 * WHERE: Redirect target of the dashboard layout / ONBOARDING_INCOMPLETE
 *        handler, and of the team-switcher "Create organization". Reads
 *        getCachedSession; routes via AUTH_ROUTES / PORTAL_PATH.
