/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: OrganizationMember, OrganizationRoleRow
 *
 * WHAT:  Client types for the team UI, derived from the tRPC router output so
 *        they can't drift from the server contract.
 * WHY:   Router-derived shapes (same pattern as use-active-organization) — no
 *        hand-rolled mirror of the member/role payloads.
 * WHERE: Consumed by the team _components (member list, sheets, ownership card).
