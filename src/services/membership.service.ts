/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: getUserMemberships
 *
 * WHAT:  Pure Prisma DB access — returns every organization membership a user
 *        belongs to, with the organization row joined in.
 * WHY:   Request-scoped cache() dedupes repeat lookups during one render so
 *        the org-switcher and protected procedures don't double-query. No
 *        business rules live here; this file is a single Prisma read.
 * WHERE: Consumed by org-discovery flows in src/trpc/routers/organization.ts
 *        and anywhere the active-org lookup needs the full membership list.
