/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: proxy, config, REGISTRATION_OPEN,
 *   EMAIL_AUTH_ENABLED, AUTH_ROUTES
 *
 * WHAT:  Next.js 16 routing middleware — short-circuits static assets, forwards
 *        x-pathname/x-hostname to RSCs, redirects /sign-up when registration is
 *        closed, and redirects the password-recovery routes when credential
 *        auth is disabled.
 * WHY:   File is named `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 rename of `middleware.ts`) and
 *        propagation goes on REQUEST headers via NextResponse.next({ request })
 *        — response headers would only reach the browser, not RSCs.
 * WHERE: Reads REGISTRATION_OPEN from src/lib/config/registration and
 *        EMAIL_AUTH_ENABLED from src/lib/config/auth-methods; downstream
 *        RSCs and route handlers read the injected headers via `await headers()`.
