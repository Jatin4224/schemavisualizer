 * WHAT:  Client component + hook that wraps a trigger element and surfaces
 *        the upgrade modal when the current organization is at-limit or the
 *        plan doesn't include the feature.
 * WHY:   Server enforcement is the source of truth; this is UX only — the
 *        default loading state is fail-closed so a fast click can't slip past.
 *        Works on any RESOURCES entry with `limit` or `flag` — `nav` is not
 *        required.
 * WHERE: Reads gates from trpc.usage.getFeatureGates.
