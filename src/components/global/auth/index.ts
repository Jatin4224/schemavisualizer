/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: AuthForm, AuthShell, ForgotPasswordForm,
 *   ResetPasswordForm, AuthFormProps, AuthShellProps
 *
 * WHAT:  Barrel export for the global auth UI primitives. Mode/schema types
 *        deliberately re-exported from @/lib/types (the type source of
 *        truth) — NOT from here.
 * WHY:   One import surface for UI; one separate surface for contracts.
 * WHERE: Imported by every page under src/app/(auth)/.
