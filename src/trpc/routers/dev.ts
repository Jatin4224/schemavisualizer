/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: devRouter, getPendingEmail
 *
 * WHAT:  Local-dev helper — hands the client the action link (verification /
 *        reset) for an email that COULD NOT be sent because RESEND_API_KEY is
 *        unset, so the UI can show it in a toast.
 * WHY:   Without an email provider the verification/reset link would be lost to
 *        the server console. This surfaces it — but ONLY in development AND only
 *        while Resend is unconfigured. In production (or once a key is set) it
 *        returns null, so reset/verification links are never exposed over the
 *        wire. This must never be relied on in production.
 * WHERE: Mounted as `dev` in src/trpc/routers/_app; consumed by
 *        useDevEmailToast (sign-up + forgot-password forms). Reads the outbox
 *        in src/lib/dev-email-outbox.ts.
