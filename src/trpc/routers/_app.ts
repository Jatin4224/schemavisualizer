 * WHY:   Single composition point means new feature routers are wired by adding
 *        one line here; the type flows automatically to clients and the in-process proxy.
 * WHERE: Imported by src/trpc/server.tsx, src/trpc/react-provider.tsx, and
 *        src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts. Mounts routers from src/trpc/routers/*.
