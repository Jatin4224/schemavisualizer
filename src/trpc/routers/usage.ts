/**
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH KEYWORDS: usageRouter, AUTO_DERIVED_FROM_RESOURCES
 *
 * WHAT:  Exposes the feature-gate map for the active organization so the UI
 *        can show "you're at limit" affordances.
 * WHY:   Gate ENFORCEMENT lives in protectedProcedure and is
 *        AUTO_DERIVED_FROM_RESOURCES — every `<resource>.create` whose
 *        registry entry declares a `limit` is auto-checked, and every verb
 *        on a flag-resource is auto-checked. This router exists only to let
 *        the client read the same gate state for rendering — never to
 *        gate-check before another call.
 * WHERE: Consumed by src/components/feature-gate.tsx; mounted by
 *        src/trpc/routers/_app.ts; delegates to src/lib/feature-gate.ts.
