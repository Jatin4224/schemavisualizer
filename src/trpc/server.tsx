 * WHY:   `cache()` ensures sibling Server Components in one request share ONE
 *        QueryClient so the hydration boundary serializes a single payload; the
 *        proxy bypasses HTTP and calls procedures in-process.
 * WHERE: Imported by Server Components and route handlers that prefetch (e.g.
 *        src/app/**). Depends on src/trpc/init.ts, src/trpc/tanstack-config.ts,
 *        and src/trpc/routers/_app.ts.
